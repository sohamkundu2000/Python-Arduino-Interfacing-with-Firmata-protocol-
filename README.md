# Python-Arduino-Interfacing-with-Firmata-protocol-

What is Firmata?

Firmata is a generic protocol that allows communication between the microcontroller and
the software that is hosted on a computer. Any software from any computer host that is
capable of serial communication can communicate with the microcontroller using Firmata.



One can download Firmata Sketch from Arduino IDE.

The pyFirmata package provides useful methods to bridge the gap between Python and
Arduinoâ€™s Firmata protocol.

There are so many applications of Python -Arduino Interfacing-

We know,Arduino(ATmega microcontroller) is not so powerful to run a Machine learning Algorithim.
  With this method we can easily take the data from arduino and can run a Machine learning model
  by using genuine Machine Learning libraries in python.
